Find a dataset of your choice that you would like to analyze and visualize or just visualize. Create a plot/map/graph/network visualization through which you would show in just one picture what these data or information is about. 
You will be graded on the following: 



1. Does the code run - can someone else reproduce your work? - make sure to include the data in your submission 
2. Are you showing the results with the visualization? Are you  telling a story with the data? 
3. Are you following  Tufte's principles of visualization? 
Do not use trivial data sets on which all you can show is one basic plot (i.e., histogram). 
Submit a single .R file and a short powerpoint presentation in which you describe: the data that you used; the packages that you used; the goal of your project and the final visualization. 
Improving other existing visualizations is also acceptable.



To create a plot and add another dataset to the plot-> use 'par(new=TRUE)' inbetween the plot fxs

Which variables will we use?

	
colnames(DRC) <- make.unique(names(DRC)) #if getting duplicate 'data' error

You can use options(scipen = 999) before plotting, in order to avoid scientific notation of numbers.
